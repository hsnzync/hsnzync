### Hi! I'm Hasan Ã–zaynacÄ± ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic Javascript developer with a passion for design. I believe that good code should not only function well but also look good, and I strive to bring both aspects to every project I work on. I'm constantly working to improve both my technical and interpersonal skills, and I'm always eager to learn more. My main focus is Typescript and Javascript frameworks/libraries such as Vuejs, React, and Angular, but I'm also interested in mobile development with React Native. 

I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and find joy in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Javascript. Additionally, I have a soft spot for game development and love to bring my creativity to life through code. Join me on my journey as I continue to grow as a developer and bring new and exciting projects to life!"
