### Hi, I'm Hasan Ã–zaynacÄ± ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic Javascript engineer with a passion for design. I believe that good code should not only function well but also look good, and I strive to bring both aspects to every project I work on. I'm constantly working to improve both my technical and interpersonal skills, and I'm always eager to learn more. The majority of my projects have been crafted using JavaScript frameworks, in combination with TypeScript.
